# Heart Disease Prediction App

This Streamlit web app predicts the risk of heart disease based on user inputs. The interface allows users to enter key health parameters such as age, sex, chest pain type, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, blood sugar levels, ECG results, heart rate, and more. The machine learning model then analyzes the data and provides an instant prediction.

ðŸ”¹ Features:

User-Friendly Interface â€“ Simple and interactive UI for easy data input
Real-Time Prediction â€“ Get instant results after submitting details
Multiple Input Parameters â€“ Includes all important health factors for better accuracy
Risk Assessment â€“ Displays whether the user has a low or high risk of heart disease

ðŸ”¹ How It Works:

Enter your details in the input fields.
Click the "Predict" button.
The model processes the inputs and provides a risk assessment result (e.g., "Low Risk: No Heart Disease Detected").
This tool is designed to provide quick health insights, but it does not replace professional medical advice.
